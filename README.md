Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning
This repository contains a Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System built using machine learning techniques. The primary goal of this project is to recommend suitable crops based on specific agricultural parameters, such as soil nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. Additionally, the system can suggest the ideal fertilizer types for improving soil conditions for different crops.

Features
Dataset Loading and Analysis:

The system starts by loading a crop recommendation dataset and performing a basic analysis, including data preview, missing values check, duplicate row identification, and descriptive statistics.
Data Visualization:

Visualizations are provided to better understand the dataset, such as heatmaps for detecting missing values and value counts for categorical variables (e.g., crop types).
Basic Data Insights:

Insights are extracted from the dataset, including distribution statistics, column names, and missing data checks.
Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains data for over 2200 samples across 7 features:

N: Nitrogen content in the soil
P: Phosphorus content in the soil
K: Potassium content in the soil
temperature: Temperature of the area (in Celsius)
humidity: Humidity of the area (in percentage)
ph: pH value of the soil
rainfall: Rainfall in the area (in mm)
label: Crop label, representing the type of crop (e.g., rice, maize, coffee)
Key Steps:
Data Loading: The system reads data from a CSV file and checks for errors.
Data Analysis: Basic information about the dataset is displayed, such as missing values, duplicates, and statistics.
Visualization: Missing values are visualized with a heatmap to ensure data quality.
Feature Analysis: The value distribution of the crop types (labels) is analyzed to understand the frequency of each crop in the dataset.
Technologies Used:
Python: For implementing the data processing and analysis.
Libraries:
pandas for data handling
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib & seaborn for data visualization
Getting Started:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-fertilizer-recommendation.git
Install required dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the crop_recommendation.py script to load and analyze the data.
Next Steps:
Implement machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to predict the best crop based on input parameters.
Integrate fertilizer recommendations based on soil nutrient levels.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of over 2200 samples with 7 features:

N, P, K: Soil nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall: Environmental factors
Label: Crop type (e.g., rice, maize, coffee)
Technologies:
Python for data processing
Pandas for handling data
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Usage:
